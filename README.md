# COVID-19 Data Analysis

Using PySpark and Databricks platform, Jomikael Ruiz performed an analysis of COVID-19 Deaths & Cases from the inception of the Global Pandemic, all the way until late 2022.

The Jupyter notebook is meant to be used on the Databricks platform to showcase a better visualization of the trends throughout time, the major spikes in cases, deaths, as well as the overall effect of vaccination efforts on global deaths.
